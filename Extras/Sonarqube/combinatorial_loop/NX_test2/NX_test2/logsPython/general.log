09:26:39:info     |     Some instances (Register File, Carry, Cross Domain Clock and Clock Switch) use Functional Elements (FEs) to accomodate signal input(s) and output(s).
09:26:39:info     |     These FEs are automatically created when processing the design. Please check the CookBook for more information.
09:26:39:info     |     The following table details the use of FEs.
